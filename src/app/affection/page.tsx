                        The King's Affection is a historical romance K-Drama set in the Joseon Dynasty, where societal rules and royal secrets collide. The story follows a young woman, Dam-i, who is forced to assume the identity of her twin brother, the crown prince, after his untimely death. Living as Lee Hwi, she must conceal her true identity to survive in a male-dominated palace â€” all while navigating the complexities of court politics, loyalty, and forbidden love.

                        As she rises to power, Lee Hwi forms a close bond with her royal tutor, Jung Ji-woon, who has no idea of her true identity. Their growing connection is as dangerous as it is heartfelt, testing the boundaries of gender, duty, and love in a world that demands silence and sacrifice.
